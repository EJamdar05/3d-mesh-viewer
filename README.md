# 3D Mesh Viewer

# About
3D Mesh Viewer is a 3D graphics program, built using C++ and OpenFrameworks, that takes in an .obj file, reads the contents, and loads in the 3D model, only based off verticies and face data.
The model can be viewed in a filled state, wireframe state and can be viewed at many angles. In addition, the GUI control panel provides the user the ability to load in other 3D models, 
observe the total amount of verticies in the model, total number of faces in the model, total size of the model in KB and adjacent triangles can also be seen via the slider.
